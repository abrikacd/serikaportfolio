        <p class="description">I’m Rika, an independent artist who enjoys watching classic horror movies like The Birds and The Shining.<br> I started off sketching My Little Pony characters onto my math workbooks, creating imaginary plots<br> where Twilight Sparkle invited me for brunch and Queen Chrysalis had matching BFF bracelets with me.<br> Now, I draw to invoke new thoughts and discussions,<br> even if they come a few days late. 

            <br><br>When I’m not testing out new, unconventional art-styles,<br>there’s a very high chance you can catch me painting my<br> dog, hushing her to not move as I finish the laaaaast brush stroke.
